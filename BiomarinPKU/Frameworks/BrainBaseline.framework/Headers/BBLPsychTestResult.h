/**
 A percentile score is computed for a given population.
 
 The population in this case is automatically deciphered from the category
 and user properties.
 
 For example, "everyone", "all males", etc. Populations are grouped into
 categories "gender" with bands for "male" and "female". A user is then
 mapped to a particular band based on various criteria
 (survey responses, characteristics, etc).
 
 The possible populations are defined by the "metrics.json" file in the
 resource bundle.
 
 If the result is `nil`, the user cannot be matched to a particular
 population. This would most likely occur because the `user` is missing
 properties required to match a population in the given category. For example,
 if the gender property is missing from the user, then the score for
 the gender category will be `nil`.
 
 Another reason it may be `nil` is if there is not enough data available
 in the population to generate a score.
 
 @param category The population category such as "overall" or "age" to which
                 the score is compared.
